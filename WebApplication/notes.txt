Will move the example frontend methods over to the MEAN stack application

the record/play plugin.c is being modified

Consume Media Process:

The process is to capture video in angular and send that stream to Janus webRTC leveraging the "recordplay.c" plugin. The plugin accepts the incoming RTP packets and transforms them into frame. As frame come across there can be repeats, ie if frame(i) == frame(i-1), drop frame(i) and keep a unique flow [I think a total of 250ms of delay is the max acceptable.] These frames are then loaded into a python script which will apply the following.

Transform Media Process:

We will have a full body photo-realistic human obj file, with the person's face 'rigged' using blender/python. Facial Landmarks code is already written in python. Using a python scene, we will place the person in a certain location and track the landmarks and move the Avatar's face as such. This will be recorded to a frame and that frame will be transformed into RTP packets and sent back to the sender of the original packet.

Skype for Business Process:

The incoming RTP packets will be consumed by SfB
