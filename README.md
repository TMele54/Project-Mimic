# mimic
An Augmented Reality application which allows any Skype for Business user to control (during a video call) a customized "mimic'd" three dimensional and photo-realistic Avatar recorded and optimized using the Structure Sensor and Skanect/Blender Rendering Software. This application leverages several technologies including ['Janus webRTC Multi-Media Server", "Blender Rigging", "Real-Time Face Landmark Tracking (eventually will be full body skeleton), "Real-Time motion control",  "Frame Interpolation"]. These technologies are combined and hosted on AWS using a proprietary MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular 6, and Node) Stack with User Access control and remote call Replay. Additionally, we are providing Remote Viewer Media Broadcast (RVMB).

Continued work, using elements of this project, will contain heavy use of Human Computer Interaction via a 
	"Deep, Artificall Attention & Social Chat-Avatar Interface"
